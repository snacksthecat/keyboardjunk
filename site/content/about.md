This is my personal blog where I document my keyboard projects.


I'm pretty much always interested in buying and/or selling items.  Please feel welcome to reach out to me if you have any questions or offers.

[keyboardjunk@outlook.com](mailto:keyboardjunk@outlook.com)

I'm pretty open-minded and always like trying out new boards.

That being said, there are just a few things that I'm not particularly interested in buying (not because they're not awesome; just because I've already got some that I'm happy with).

Those kinds of items would be:

* Cherry MX keyboards
* IBM Model M / Model F
* Apple Extended Keyboards (and AEK II)
* Apple M0110 (and M0110A)

Thanks for reading :)
