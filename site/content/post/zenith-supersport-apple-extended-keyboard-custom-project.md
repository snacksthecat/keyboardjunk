This project began when I came across a set of vintage Alps keycaps from a Zenith Supersport 286 laptop on [/r/mechmarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket).  By the time I saw the post, the set had unfortunately been picked up by someone else.  Luckily, the buyer said he had a similar set in better condition but the set was missing a couple of keys.

## Keycaps

When the keycaps arrived in the mail I immediately fell in love with them.  They were high quality doubleshot ABS with really cool pad-printed Russian sublegends.  Seeing that this set came from an old laptop, they were of course in a non-standard layout.  I really liked the isolated position of the arrow cluster and had it set in my mind to reproduce that (an idea I eventually abandoned).

I knew that I'd be doing a custom build with them but didn't have any immediate ideas.  I cleaned the keycaps up and stuck them in my growing box of random keyboard parts.

## Switches

Over some time I came across a really good deal on an old Apple Extended Keyboard.  It was just about as dirty as you can imagine.  For this reason I figured it would make a good donor board.

The AEK had Alps SKCM orange switches but they were very dusty and felt quite scratchy to type on.  I had read about people having success cleaning Alps switches using an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner.

So that's how I ended up buying a jewlery cleaner.  Honestly, it's one of my favorite tools now and I clean just about everything in it (well, anything that fits).  I slowly desolered all of the switches to the best of my ability.

Once I got them all off of the board I went to work disassembling each one into its individual components.  I cleaned each set of switch components in the jewelry cleaner with water and denture tabs (my second favorite tool).  After they were clean I reassembled each one.  The whole process took about a day but I'm sure others could do it much faster.

## Plate

I love the feel of keyboards with steel mounting plates.  It's just such a solid typing experience.  I'd had luck in the past ordering from [Lasergist](https://www.lasergist.com) so I'd be ordering from them again.

With the help of [keyboard-layout-editor.com](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com) I reproduced the layout online.  Then I used the equally awesome tool [swillkb](https://builder.swillkb.com) to translate the layout into the appropriate cuts for an Alps plate.  I can't stress how awesome these two tools are!

I'd decided that I also wanted a steel backplate for this special board and luckily the prices at Lasergist weren't crazy so it was not much more expensive.  I'm glad I did this because this keyboard has such a nice, solid feel to it as a result.

## Case

The swillkb tool outputs gists of each layer that you would need for a sandwich-style keyboard case.  I decided on red acrylic for the middle layers and ordered these from [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com).  Once these pieces arrived in the mail, I pretty much had everything I needed to get started with the build.

## Wiring

This was my second handwired board and I'm admitedly not the best at it.  I wired up all of the rows and columns to the Teensy 2.0 and crammed the whole thing into my custom case.  I was running short on room so I sacraficed having a nice USB port cutout and instead opted for this weird rat tail hanging out the back.  If I'd had more patience, it'd definitely been worth it to do a nicer job on this part.

## Final Thoughts

I'm really happy with how the end product turned out.  The orange Alps feel super nice and the layout is actually very practical and modern (well, for a laptop).  The keys didn't come with stabilizers and the spacebar was a very non-standard 5.5 units so I ended up cutting/bending a larger one to fit.  As a result, the spacebar is a little bit squeeky but I probably only notice this because I'm aware of the hack.

Like I mentioned earlier, I abandoned the cool arrow cluster and instead opted for this style layout:

    [PgDown][PgUp][←][↓][→]

That's right; no up arrow for me.  I don't even miss it to be honest (okay maybe a little).  Anyways, not a big deal.  All in all great keyboard.
