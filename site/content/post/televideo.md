A lot has happened since I last posted here several months ago.

Keyboard-wise, I've gotten very much into learning more about designing and building converters.  This prompted me to order about 40 Televideo 925-style keyboards from [elecplus](https://www.elecshopper.com) with the goal of converting and reselling them.

Fixing these up turned out to be a **TON** of work but quite a bit of fun as well.  I wanted to share a bit about the process I've been taking each board through.  Usually I'm doing a few at a time, grouping like boards together.

**Before:**

**Step 1: Map out PCB**  
Using a multimeter set to continuity check mode to check which pins correspond to the rows and columns. I mark the pins with a permanent marker.

**Step 2: Remove keycaps**  
Space invaders can be a little bit tricky to remove the caps. I use a sideways prying motion to pop them off.

**Step 3: Remove unnecessary components**  
Removed all of the unnecessary passive components like resistors which can pull the signal down and give weird key presses.

**Step 4: Desolder ICs**  
Since we're replacing the controller, these aren't needed any longer

**Step 5: Dust the life out of it**  
This thing is awesome. So much better than canned air and it's paid for itself several times over

**Step 6: Clean the keycaps**

First I soak them with dish soap then run them through an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner a few times.

**Step 7: Clean the case**

I use a mr clean magic eraser which gets off all of the marks with minimal elbow greaseÂ

**Step 8: Solder pins onto teensy**  
I use a breadboard to keep things in place while I solder the pins.

Thought about socketing it but my pins were a bit too fat to fit.

**Step 10: Replace keycaps**  
Luckily I have lots of boards to use as a reference.

**Step 11: Test matrix**  
Just making sure everything was traced out correctly.

**Step 12: Map matrix**  
I have a little arduino sketch I wrote which prints the row and column for each key. Makes this job a lot easier

**Step 13: Program TMK**  
I love TMK! Looks tricky but it's fairly straight forward once you've done it a couple times.

**Step 14: LED**  
Forgot about the LED so I had to do it after the fact.

**Step 15: Compile and flash**  
Fingers crossed.... IT COMPILES!!!!!
